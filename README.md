# Air-Canvas-project
The OpenCV Air Canvas project is an interactive application that allows users to draw on a virtual canvas using hand gestures in the air, without touching any physical surface. This project utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and track the user's hand movements, which are then translated into drawing commands on a digital canvas.
